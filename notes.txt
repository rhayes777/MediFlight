- Save pill times (name, size, time of day)
- Search start location (default current)
- Search destination
- Enter flight date

- Each pill time should find closest destination possibility. That is, for 2 pills and 12 hours the pills just swap!

- If dramatic change would be required (e.g. more than half an hour a day) and new pill times would not be at night then pill time of day should be changed

Change Before Flight:
- At most half an hour a day
- If actual destination time is in current night then effective destination time is night limit between current time and destination time
- e.g. if destination time is 12pm here and current time is 10pm then effective destination time is 11pm
- Change per day should be (current time - effective destination time) / days till trip

Change After Flight:
- At most half an hour a day
- Convert from current time to destination time in half hour increments
